# sinatra-kickstart

This is what I use as a template for my Sinatra applications.

Parts of the code were inspired by the work of [Raf](https://github.com/rafBM) and [Ã‰tienne](https://github.com/EtienneLem) at [Heliom](http://heliom.ca).

## Installation and Usage

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/remiprev/sinatra-kickstart.git
$ cd sinatra-kickstart
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec shotgun start --host 0.0.0.0
== Shotgun/Thin on http://0.0.0.0:9393/
>> Thin web server (v1.5.0 codename Knife)
>> Maximum connections set to 1024
>> Listening on 0.0.0.0:9393, CTRL+C to stop
```
